Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
The time to increase predition number is more of an exponential function 


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
It looks like predictions went exponential after about 1000
